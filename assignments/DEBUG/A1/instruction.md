Welcome to the world of programming. First, let's write a program saying hello to its user.

Your program reads one word (your name) from the standard input, say `Luke`.

Then it prints `Hello, Luke!` to the standard output.

Note that your program's main function should return `0`, indicating that the execution is successful.
