Welcome to the world of programming. First, let's write a program saying hello to its user.

It just prints `Hello, world!!!` to the standard output (i.e., cout). Be careful - the autograder is case sensitive and counts the number of (special) characters. Your job is to get an idea how to deal with the picky autograder.

Note that your program's main function should return `0`, indicating that the execution was successful.
